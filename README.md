**PHP Start Tag**: (<?php) Starts the PHP file and tells 
the computer to start and stop interpreting the code.

**Unit Testing**: (CarTest.php) Defined by Keith Williams 
as "One of the greatest things to add to a resume." 
Unit Testing is essentially a way developers test small chunks
of their code in bits to avoid global errors when using the code
across different projects.  

**Type Declarations**: [(declare(strict_types=1);] Type 
declarations come in two flavours: coercive (default) 
and strict. The following types for parameters can be 
used: strings (string), integers (int), floating-point 
numbers (float), and booleans (bool).

**use**: (use Car;) imports the specified namespace 
(or class) to the current scope. 

**extends**: (final class CarTest **extends** TestCase) 
the keyword that enables inheritance

<The format we'll be using will be dictionary style. 
You have the term, then you add ":", then add an example 
of the termand the definition of the term-->

There will be direct examples of in class assignments. 
Currently only the CarTest worked in class

**PHP Start Tag**: (<?php) Starts the PHP file and tells 
the computer to start and stop interpreting the code.

**Unit Testing**: (CarTest.php) Defined by Keith Williams 
as "One of the greatest things to add to a resume." 
Unit Testing is essentially a way developers test small chunks
of their code in bits to avoid global errors when using the code
across different projects.  

**Type Declarations**: [(declare(strict_types=1);] Type 
declarations come in two flavours: coercive (default) 
and strict. The following types for parameters can be 
used: strings (string), integers (int), floating-point 
numbers (float), and booleans (bool).

**use**: (use Car;) imports the specified namespace 
(or class) to the current scope. 

**extends**: (final class CarTest **extends** TestCase) 
the keyword that enables inheritance.  

**public**: (**public** function testCanCreateCar(): void) 
scope to make that variable/function available from 
anywhere, other classes and instances of the object.

**private**:(**private** function testCanCreateCar(): void) 
scope when you want your variable/function to be 
visible in its own class only.

**protected**:(**protected** function testCanCreateCar(): void)) 
scope when you want to make your variable/function visible 
in all classes that extend current class including the 
parent class.
